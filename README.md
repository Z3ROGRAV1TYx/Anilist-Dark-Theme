# Anilist-Dark-Theme

This is a theme created for Anilist to enhance the user's viewing experience. 


## How To Install:
**Install [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)** *(or a similar extension):*

*(It is not reccomended to use Stylish, due to it not being open source, and many past issues regarding analytics, telemetry, data-collection and more.)*

**Install The Userstyle:** [Gravity's Dark Anilist - 174885](https://userstyles.org/styles/174885/gravity-s-dark-anilist)

- Go to [anilist.co](https://anilist.co/home) and ensure that the theme is enabled in Stylus *(or addon of choice).*
- Go to [anilist.co/settings](https://anilist.co/settings) and ensure that the "Site Theme" is set to 'Dark', otherwise the userstyle may not work properly!

**Optional:** I highly reccomend installing this alongside @Hoh's [Greasyfork - Aniscripts - 370473](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370473-aniscripts)

- To install Hoh's script, you must install it through a Userscript manager extension.
*(I highly reccomend [ViolentMonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey))*

## Extra Information:

This is still in the works, there may be bugs or many broken things in the theme.
I am still new to CSS, please feel free to offer help and notify me of any issues with the theme.
This theme is forked from Erwin's Anilist theme (which is a fork of Hoh's theme.)

I created this to play around with and personalize my Anilist experience to my liking.
