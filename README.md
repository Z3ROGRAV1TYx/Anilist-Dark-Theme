# Anilist-Dark-Theme


How To Install:

Install Stylus (or a similar extension): https://add0n.com/stylus.html
(It is not reccomended to use Stylish, due to it not being open source, and many past issues regarding analytics, telemetry, data-collection and more.)

Then install the userstyle from the provided link:

Userstyles Link: https://userstyles.org/styles/170056/gravity-s-anilist-theme
(You can also manually import the .css file from git if you wish, you will not receive automatic updates keep in mind.)

Go to https://anilist.co/home and ensure that the theme is enabled in Stylus (or addon of choice).

Go to https://anilist.co/settings and ensure that the "Site Theme" is set to 'Dark', otherwise the userstyle will not work properly!

Extra Information:

This is still in the works, there may be bugs or many broken things in the theme.
I am still new to CSS, please feel free to offer help and notify me of any issues with the theme.
This theme is forked from Erwin's Anilist theme, which is a fork of Hoh's theme.
I created this to play around with and personalize my Anilist experience to my liking.
If you install this, I highly reccomend installing alongside Hoh's script.
