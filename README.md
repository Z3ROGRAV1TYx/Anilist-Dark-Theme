# Anilist-Dark-Theme
My custom dark theme for Anilist.

This is still in the works, there may be bugs or many broken things in the theme.
I am still new to CSS, please feel free to offer help and notify me of any issues with the theme.

Notes:
This theme is forked from Erwin's Anilist theme, which is a fork of Hoh's theme.
I created this to play around with and personalize my Anilist experience to my liking.

If you install this, I highly reccomend installing alongside Hoh's script.
