# Anilist-Dark-Theme

This is a theme created for Anilist to enhance the user's viewing experience. 


# How To Install:
**Install Stylus (or a similar extension):** [Stylus Home Page](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
(It is not reccomended to use Stylish, due to it not being open source, and many past issues regarding analytics, telemetry, data-collection and more.)

## Then Install The Userstyle From The Provided Link:

**Userstyles Link:** [Gravity's Dark Anilist - 174885](https://userstyles.org/styles/174885/gravity-s-dark-anilist)
(You can also manually import the .css file from git if you wish, you will not receive automatic updates keep in mind.)

- Go to [Anilist.co](https://anilist.co/home) and ensure that the theme is enabled in Stylus (or addon of choice).
- Go to [Anilist.co/Settings](https://anilist.co/settings) and ensure that the "Site Theme" is set to 'Dark', otherwise the userstyle may not work properly!

## Extra Information:

This is still in the works, there may be bugs or many broken things in the theme.
I am still new to CSS, please feel free to offer help and notify me of any issues with the theme.
This theme is forked from Erwin's Anilist theme, which is a fork of Hoh's theme.
I created this to play around with and personalize my Anilist experience to my liking.
If you install this, I highly reccomend installing alongside Hoh's script.

Hoh's Script: [Greasyfork - Aniscripts - 370473](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370473-aniscripts)
